   UTF8 content-length encode error.
   solution:
   - use a valid web server, check the right header
     find current content-length is based on byte(not utf8 word)
   - think about the difference, and fix it 
     found it is a bug: https://github.com/eventmachine/evma_httpserver/pull/12
     but the gem is not uptodate with github master version,
     so I create a gem: evma_httpserver_update
     it fix the bug.
** solr index should aysnc
** index big directory halt
** server cpu high
